## Architecture: Microservice Architecture.
We chose to go with a microservice architecture because the app contains many features which are independent of each other e.g blog vs flow tracking. Keeping these features separate allows them to be independently deployable and scalable. These are concepts that we as devops people need to keep in mind. If some areas in the app are more in demand than others, we want an architecture that can scale with that demand - something we canâ€™t do with a monolithic app.
